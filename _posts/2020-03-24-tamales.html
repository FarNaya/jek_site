<h2>Tamales</h2>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<h4>Dried Corn Husks:</h4>
<p> These may be available in the Mexican or produce section of your grocery store, or if not, you can order them on Amazon.  In general, you want to look for tamale husks that are wide enough to wrap around the entire tamale filling.  But if you happen to get a bag of husks that are fairly narrow, hakuna matata, you can just overlap two on top of each other.  We will also shred a few husks into lots of long skinny pieces to tie the tamales together.</p>

<h4>Masa (Dough) Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Masa Harina: Finely-ground nixtamalized corn flour.  (“Maseca” is the most popular brand.)</li>
<li>Corn Oil or Avocado Oil: I prefer these two, but any mild-flavored oil will do.</li>
<li>Stock: Chicken, beef or vegetable stock will work — yoou pick!</li>
<li>Baking Powder, Salt and Ground Cumin: To season the masa.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Filling:</h4>
<p> You can fill these tamales with just about anything!You will need about 2-3 cups of filling this recipe, so feel free to mix and match whatever sounds good.  Ideas could include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Any kind of cooked, shredded chicken will do.  Shredding a large rotisserie chicken would be the quick and easiest route here.  Or, you could make (and shred) my recipe for Baked Chicken Breasts, or make this delicious 3-Ingredient Mexican Shredded Chicken in the slow cooker or Instant Pot.</li>

<li><strong>Beef:</strong> Any kind of cooked and shredded (or ground) beef will do.  You could brown some ground beef, or use some leftover steak or roast beef.  Or I would highly recommend making a batch of this Barbacoa Beef in the Instant Pot or slow cooker.
Pork: Any kind of cooked and shredded/pulled pork will do.  I’m a big fan of using this Carnitas recipe, either made in the Instant Pot or slow cooker.</li>

<li><strong>Refried Beans:</strong> Refried pinto or black beans are a delicious (and super-easy!) vegetarian option, which you can either use on their own, or mix with cheese and/or roasted veggies.</li>

<li><strong>Veggies:</strong>The veggies will need to be cooked ahead of time however you prefer (<– I highly recommend roasting them up), and finely-chopped.  Some tasty options could include peppers (poblano, bell, or jalapeño peppers), potatoes (Yukon gold or sweet), cauliflower, mushrooms, squash, onions, carrots…you name it.</li>

<h4>Sauce: </h4>
<p>If your filling recipe includes quite a bit of sauce (such as if you make the barbacoa or carnitas recipes), you may not need to add any extra.  But in general, I highly recommend adding some extra sauce to your meat or vegetarian fillings.  Store-bought salsa will definitely save you a big step, but feel free to go the extra mile and make homemade salsa if you’d like!  You will need about 1-ish cups of sauce for this recipe — enough to add a light coating to the filling, without making it too juicy/watery.  And then I would also recommend having lots of extra salsa on hand for serving once the tamales have cooked.  You can choose just about any kind you love.  I would recommend either:<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Red Salsa:</strong> Either homemade or store-bought, and as mild or spicy as you prefer.</li>
<li><strong>Green Salsa (Salsa Verde):</strong> Either homemade or store-bought, and as mild or spicy as you prefer</li>
<li><strong>Enchilada Sauce:</strong> This enchilada sauce recipe is my all-time fave.</li>
<li><strong>Mole: </strong>I still don’t have a recipe for mole here on the blog, but mole tamales would be incredible.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Toppings:</h4>
 <p>Once the tamales are cooked, I’m a big fan of loading them up with lots of toppings.  They are totally optional, but I would recommend any combination of:</p>
 <ul>
<li>Salsa: Red, green, or pico de gallo</li>
<li>Chopped Cilantro: always a winner</li>
<li>Avocado: always always a winner</li>
<li>Sour Cream (or Crema) or Crumbled Cotija Cheese: Delicious!</li>
</ul>



<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soak your corn husks.</strong>  Find a large stockpot or pan big enough to fit the corn husks, then fill it with very warm water and a lid.  The corn husks will float to the top, so you may need to add something to weigh them down a bit so that they are submerged.  They will need to soak for about 30 minutes, or until softened.</li>
<li><strong>Mix up your masa (dough).</strong>  Meanwhile, mix up your masa.  You can either do this in a stand mixer (the easiest) or with a hand mixer (a bit more messy) or by hand (lots of work).  Mix it up according to the recipe below, and then cover with a damp towel and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>

<li><strong>Prepare your fillings and salsa.</strong>  See options above for ideas!  Whatever sounds good to you, prepare both your fillings and salsa, them toss them together in a bowl until combined.</li>

<li><strong>Then…assemble the tamales!</strong> Prepare an assembly line of your ingredients, and get in your groove. Simple:
    <li>Lay the soaked corn husk on a flat surface.  A simple plate or cutting board will do.</li>
    <li>Spread your masa on the corn husk.  About 1/4 cup (or a little more) will do.  I highly recommend using a large cookie scoop to measure out the masa.  Use a spoon or your fingers to spread it out into a rectangle large enough to enclose your filling.  (I keep a little bowl of water nearby to dip my fingers regularly, which helps the masa from sticking to them.)</li>
    <li>Add your filling/sauce to the center of the masa.  Tamales use surprisingly little filling — just a tablespoon or two will do.  Add it to the center of your masa.</li>
    <li>Fold the corn husk in half vertically.  Then very carefully, fold the corn husk in half so that the masa wraps completely around the filling, maybe using your fingers to pinch it together just a little bit.</li>
    <li>Wrap the corn husk into a little burrito.  Continue folding the corn husk completely over to one side so that it is a burrito/cylinder shape.</li>
    <li>Fold the top (skinny) end down to enclose one end of the tamale.  The image above explains this best.  One end of the tamale will be exposed, and the other will be folded over.  (I like to fold my tamales to cover the side with the seam.</li>
    <li>Tie the tamale together.  I like to shred a few corn husks into long skinny strips to tie the tamales together (this is a perfect use for the husks that are too skinny!).  But you can also use baking string.
    Then…STEAM!  stovetop or Instant Pot .</li>
</li>
</ul>
