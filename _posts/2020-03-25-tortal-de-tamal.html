<h2>Torta de tamal</h2>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>


<ul>
<li>3 cups masa harina (preferably Maseca brand)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>2 cups warm water</li>
<li>3/4 cup cold vegetable shortening plus 1/4 cup for greasing the pot</li>
<li>1/2 cup cold fresh pork lard (asiento)</li>
<li>1 cup chilled chicken broth</li>
<li>1/2 package dried cornhusks, soaked or 4 (12-inch) squares fresh â€¨banana leaf, toasted</li>
<li>4 cups favorite tamal filling</li>
</ul>

<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
<p>Stir together the masa harina, baking powder, and salt with a whisk until well blended. Add the warm water all at once and mix with a spoon or your hand until evenly moistened. With a hand beater, whip 3/4 cup shortening and lard on medium speed until fluffy and creamy. Add the masa mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, beating until smooth after each addition. Beat in the cold chicken stock a few tablespoons at a time.</p>
<p>With the remaining 1/4 cup shortening, liberally coat the bottom and sides of a five or six quart slow cooker insert.
Line the bottom and two-thirds of the way up the sides with the corn husks or banana leaves, slightly overlapping the edges.
Place half of the masa in the bottom of the cooker and spread evenly to the edges and 1/2 inch up the sides of the insert.
Cover evenly with the filling.</p>
<p>Spread the remaining masa over the filling.</p>
<p>Cover the masa with a layer of cornhusks or a piece of banana leaf.</p>
<p>Cover and cook on low for 4 hours, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>
<p>The torta may be served at once or kept warm for several hours on low heat.</p>
