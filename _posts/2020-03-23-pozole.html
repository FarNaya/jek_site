<h2>Pozole</h2>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>3/4 cup dried chiles de arbol</li>
<li>4 or 5 dried ancho chiles</li>
<li>6 cloves garlic (2 smashed, 4 finely chopped)</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, trimmed and cut in half</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 large white onion, chopped</li>
<li>8 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano (preferably Mexican)</li>
<li>1 bay leaf</li>
<li>3 15-ounce cans white hominy, drained and rinsed</li>
<li>Diced avocado, shredded cabbage, diced onion, sliced radishes and/or fresh cilantro, for topping</li>

<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Break the stems off the chiles de arbol and ancho chiles and shake out as many seeds as possible. Put the chiles in a bowl and cover with boiling water; weigh down the chiles with a plate to keep them submerged and soak until soft, about 30 minutes. Transfer the chiles and 1 1/2 cups of the soaking liquid to a blender. Add the smashed garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt and blend until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pushing the sauce through with a rubber spatula; discard the solids.</p></li>

<li><p>Rub the pork all over with the cumin and 1/2 teaspoon salt; set aside. Heat the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic and cook 2 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high. Push the onion and garlic to one side of the pot; add the pork to the other side and sear, turning, until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>Stir in 2 cups water, the chicken broth, oregano, bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of the chile sauce (depending on your taste). Bring to a low boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Partially cover and cook, turning the pork a few times, until tender, about 3 hours.</p></li>

<li><p>Stir in the hominy and continue to simmer, uncovered, until the pork starts falling apart, about 1 more hour. Remove the bay leaf. Transfer the pork to a cutting board; roughly chop and return to the pot. Add some water or broth if the posole is too thick. Season with salt. Serve with assorted toppings and the remaining chile sauce.</p></li>
